# Task 1: Scalable Social Media Architecture

## **Design Diagram**

Hereâ€™s a high-level architecture diagram for a scalable social media platform:

[User] --> [Load Balancer] --> [Web Servers] --> [Caching Layer] --> [Database]

[Message Queue] --> [Background Workers] --> [Analytics DB]

## **Justifications**

### **1. Choice of Database**

- **NoSQL (e.g., MongoDB or Cassandra):**

  - Handles unstructured data like posts, comments, and user profiles efficiently.
  - Scales horizontally to accommodate millions of users.
  - Provides high availability and fault tolerance.

- **Why Not SQL?**
  - SQL databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) are less efficient for unstructured data and horizontal scaling.

---

### **2. Use of Load Balancing**

- **Purpose:**

  - Distributes incoming traffic across multiple web servers to ensure high availability and reliability.
  - Prevents any single server from becoming a bottleneck.

- **Implementation:**
  - Use AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) or NGINX for load balancing.

### **3. Caching Strategies**

- **In-Memory Caching (e.g., Redis or Memcached):**

  - Stores frequently accessed data (e.g., user profiles, posts) to reduce database load.
  - Improves response times for read-heavy workloads.

- **CDN (Content Delivery Network):**
  - Caches static assets (e.g., images, videos) closer to users for faster delivery.

## **Components of the Architecture**

1. **Load Balancer:**

   - Distributes user requests across multiple web servers.
   - Ensures no single server is overwhelmed.

2. **Web Servers:**

   - Handle user requests (e.g., login, posting, commenting).
   - Serve dynamic content and interact with the database.

3. **Caching Layer:**

   - Stores frequently accessed data to reduce database queries.
   - Improves performance and reduces latency.

4. **Database:**

   - Stores user data, posts, comments, and other information.
   - NoSQL database for scalability and flexibility.

5. **Message Queue:**

   - Handles asynchronous tasks (e.g., sending notifications, processing images).
   - Example: Kafka or RabbitMQ.

6. **Background Workers:**

   - Process tasks from the message queue (e.g., analytics, notifications).
   - Ensures the main application remains responsive.

7. **Analytics DB:**
   - Stores data for analytics and reporting (e.g., user activity, engagement metrics).
   - Example: Elasticsearch or a time-series database.
